    <h1>Welcome To My Solution!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>"Hello, my name is Ash Thomas, thank you for taking the time to review my example. All posts from a user are fetched at once to keep page response fast for the end-user. In a larger setting,
      this could cause performance issues and would need to be requested in parsed packages, with a pagination.<br><br> 
      Some basic linking functions are available on the email and website table cells. 'conrad.com' is a real site that shows working functionality.<br><br>
      Styles are basic using simple greyscale and a single color for readability and clean
      presentation. Not much time was able to be devoted to the style polish stage to keep myself within the time guidelines. Please refer to my portfolio site and Wyldgreens, LumberJack, and
      LooseLeashDog projects for my full UX/design capabilities."</p>
